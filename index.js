// PART 1: printing with prompt
// Prompt the user for a number and cast it to a number
let number = prompt("Enter a number")

// Prompt the user for another number that is bigger than the first number and cast it to a number
let num1 = prompt("Enter a bigger number ")



// Write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to print all numbers from the first number to the second number
 for (){
  console.log(number+num1)
}







// PART 2: Averaging an array
// Create an array of numbers 
let nums = [2,4,6,6,7,8,2,9]


// Write a for loop that calculates the sum of the elements 
for 






// Using the sum, calculate the average of all the elements (sum divided by the length of the array)
